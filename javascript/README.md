# JavaScript


## Callback vs Promises Vs Async Await

async await >> promises chain >> callback hell
## Callback

A CallBack is a function passed as an argument to another function.


### Callback Hell
Nested callbacks stacked below one another forming a pyramid structure (pyramid of doom).

This style of programming becomes difficult to understand and manage.
